# Asset Mappers
This is the repo for the Asset Mappers application, which places markers representing resources available in the City of Orange, NJ with links to their websites on an interactive map.

## Required Technology

## Getting Started  
1. Install the GitHub client or Git  
2. Clone our repo
3. `cd` into the cloned repo's directory on your computer
4. Run `ionic platform add <android|ios>` to allow for emulation on either platform, and `ionic emulate <android|ios>` to begin emulation.       
5. Run `ionic serve` if you'd prefer to run this app in a web-browser (be aware during debugging that some bugs may only be present in the emulator as opposed to the web-server, and vice-versa)  


## Setting Up an Emulator
For emulation with Android phones, install Android Studio (which will install the Android SDK) and use it to install a virtual device onto your computer.  This will allow you to emulate an Android phone of your choosing so that you may run the app on it.
